        		<h1> Research </h1>
			<p> My research interests are centered on inflectional morphology and the application of comparative and computational methods that can be used to model both synchronic language and diachronic processes of morphological change. In practice, my research program is motivated by typological concerns â€“ I believe that our theories should necessarily be able to account for a wide range of linguistic data. To this end, I often draw on cross-linguistically uncommon phenomena to probe their resilience when confronted with exceptional inflectional systems. More specifically, my approach integrates mutually informative tools and concepts from disparate yet compatible subfields of linguistics, including morphological theory construction, traditional historical linguistics, modern stochastic and computational analysis of natural language and language evolution, and language documentation, in the synthesis of robust analyses of morphological processes. </p>
